The main executable creates a Tool\+Chain which is an object that holds Tools. Tools are added to the Tool\+Chain and then the Tool\+Chain can be told to Initialise Execute and Finalise each Tool in the chain.

The Tool\+Chain also holds a uesr defined \mbox{\hyperlink{classDataModel}{Data\+Model}} which each Tool has access too and can read ,update and modify. This is the method by which data is passed between Tools.

User Tools can be generated for use in the Tool\+Chain by included scripts.
